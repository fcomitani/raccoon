Recursive Algorithm for Coarse-to-fine Clusters OptimizatiON (raccoon) is a python 3 package for recursive clustering automatization. 
It searches for the optimal clusters in your data by running low information features removal, non-linear dimensionality reduction, and clusters identification. Tunable parameters at each of these steps are automatically set as to maximize a clustering "goodness" score.
This process is then repeated recursively within each cluster identified.
